# Simon Game
This project is a Simon Game implemented in C for an Arduino microcontroller.
It uses hardware inputs (push buttons, potentiometer) and outputs (buzzer, LEDs) to create an interactive memory game where the player must repeat an increasingly long sequence of tones and lights.
The program is written in C and compiled with the AVR-GCC toolchain, directly interfacing with the Arduinoâ€™s registers via <avr/io.h>.
